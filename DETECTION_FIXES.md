# Malware Detection Improvements

## Changes Made to Fix Detection Issues

1. **Enhanced PDF Detection**:
   - Added more aggressive detection for JavaScript in PDFs
   - Implemented direct content scanning for PDFs that bypasses PyPDF2 errors
   - Added detection for suspicious JavaScript commands like `app.launchURL`, `eval`, etc.
   - Lowered the threshold for classifying a PDF as malicious to 2+ suspicious features
   - Added detection for Launch actions, URI/URL commands, and more

2. **Enhanced PE (Executable) Detection**:
   - Implemented more comprehensive suspicious pattern detection
   - Added detection for many common malicious patterns in executable files
   - Increased weighting for critical indicators (network activity, process creation)
   - Implemented scoring system for suspicious indicators
   - Lowered the threshold for classifying an executable as malicious to 2+ suspicious features

3. **Hash Verification Improvements**:
   - Updated the `verified_hashes.csv` file with the correct SHA-256 hashes
   - Ensured hash verification takes precedence over all other detection methods
   - Fixed the PE file hash detection to properly check against the database

4. **Code Structure Improvements**:
   - Created a fallback basic content scan for both PDF and PE files
   - Ensured proper error handling so detection completes even when errors occur
   - Added a dedicated test script to verify detection accuracy

## Detection Logic Used

- **PDF Detection**:
  - Check for JavaScript code
  - Check for auto-open actions
  - Check for embedded files
  - Check for launch commands
  - Check for URI/URL actions
  - Check for suspicious JavaScript commands
  - Score each suspicious feature and classify as malicious if score exceeds threshold

- **PE Detection**:
  - Check for suspicious strings
  - Check for network capabilities
  - Check for process creation capabilities
  - Check for memory manipulation
  - Check for dynamic library loading
  - Score each suspicious indicator and classify as malicious if score exceeds threshold

- **Text File Detection**:
  - Check for suspicious keywords
  - Check for encoded commands
  - Check for script execution patterns

## Testing Methodology

A dedicated test script (`test_detector.py`) was created to automatically test all target files:
- safe_file.txt
- malicious_file_1.txt
- hello.exe
- safe_pdf_file.pdf
- malicious_pdf_test.pdf

Each file is analyzed, and the detection results are printed to verify correct classification.
